## Basic
A [Discord](http://discord.gg) Bot I made with Python.<br/>
[Click here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=538309371722072065&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add to server.
## What does it do
```yml
Prefix: -
hey/hi/wassup/ect: Replies
vsauce: quotes him

meme: uploads meme
ping: hey bot says hi to google for u
online: checks if hey bot is online or not
lb: leaderboard is printed (lag may occure)
stats: prints the stats
force-error: forces an error
```
Example:

```
## Rules:
### Don't steal bot!(Don't just copy and past. Made modifications!)
### Don't sell code!
